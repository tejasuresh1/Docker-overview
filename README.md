What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications. It packages applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring that software runs consistently across different environments.

Key Concepts
Container: A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
Image: A read-only template used to create containers. Images are built from Dockerfiles and stored in a registry.
Dockerfile: A script containing a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image.
Docker Hub: A cloud-based registry service for sharing Docker images.
How Docker Works
Build: Write a Dockerfile that defines your application environment and use the docker build command to create an image.
Ship: Push your Docker image to a registry like Docker Hub using the docker push command.
Run: Deploy your application by running containers from your Docker image using the docker run command.
Benefits of Docker
Consistency: Docker ensures that applications run the same way regardless of where they are deployed.
Isolation: Each container runs in its own isolated environment, ensuring that there are no conflicts between applications.
Efficiency: Containers are lightweight and share the host OS kernel, making them faster and more efficient than traditional virtual machines.
Portability: Docker images can run on any platform that supports Docker, making it easy to move applications across different environments.
Docker Architecture
Docker Engine: The core component of Docker, it consists of:
Docker Daemon (dockerd): Manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.
Docker CLI: A command-line interface for interacting with the Docker daemon.
Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file.
